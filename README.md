first you need to create a index.html file like

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>
        First Web Page
    </title>
</head>
<body>
Hello World!
</body>
</html>

EXM: https://github.com/sanjeetji/sanjeetji.github.io/blob/master/index.html

Then Make a folder like
User,Account
it is like a table for exm : https://github.com/sanjeetji/sanjeetji.github.io/tree/master

Then you need to put a json file inside the any folder and this file will be a reasponse of your file.
EXM: https://github.com/sanjeetji/sanjeetji.github.io/blob/master/Data/course.json

Now at the time to call the API in postman or need to user api in android project or anywhere you need to convert the json file 
URL into RAW URL on click on "raw" Option on the top right where you open the json file
EXM: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanjeetji/sanjeetji.github.io/refs/heads/master/Data/course.json

Now If you want to get any image in response then you can share the image url, which is already on internet
And If you want to get any specific image then you need to upload on the internet optionally you can upload the image on git hub as like you are uplaoding the json file. Like here I am uploading an image on GitHub : https://github.com/sanjeetji/sanjeetji.github.io/tree/master/Data
Now You have to opne the file on git hub like : https://github.com/sanjeetji/sanjeetji.github.io/blob/master/Data/splash_img.png

And replace the "blob" into "raw" to convert image github url into raw url like json file,
EXM: https://github.com/sanjeetji/sanjeetji.github.io/raw/master/Data/splash_img.png

And Now you put the converted URL into JSON file as an Image URL.
